                <p>
                    The 2020 Sitecore Hackathon is a free online community driven event organized by Akshay Sura and supported by Sitecore. (Shout out to Pieter,  Mark and Tamas). <br />
                    Teams that have signed up by 6 pm EST February 14, 2020 will have the opportunity to participate in the contest.
                    Eligible teams will have 24 hours — starting Friday February 28th 2020 at 8PM EST and ending Saturday February 29th 2020 at 8PM EST – to build and submit a Sitecore module best implementing the idea for the Hackathon, as determined by our panel of judges. The idea(s) will be announced an hour before the Hackathon starts on February 28th.

                                Absolutely, you can team up with any other Sitecore developer to form a team.

                                No, you can schedule your time and delegate appropriately. You can use as much or as little of the 24 hours to build your module.

                                We see this every year, where we find either an individual or a team of two, get in touch with me. I can try to pair you up with others in the similar situation and help you form a team.
